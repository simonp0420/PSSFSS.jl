Three different designs are examined that employ different loop thicknesses and different values of sheet resistance. We compare the reflection coefficient magnitudes computed by PSSFSS with those digitized from the cited figure when the sheet is suspended 5 mm above a ground plane, hence we will also make use of the pecsheet function.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/","page":"Examples","title":"Examples","text":"using Plots, PSSFSS, DelimitedFiles\nD = 11 # Period of square lattice (mm)\nr_outer = √2/2 * D/8 * [5,6,7] # radii of square outer vertices\nthickness = D/16 * [1,2,3]\nr_inner = r_outer - √2 * thickness  # radii of square inner vertices\nRs = [15,40,70] # Sheet resistance (Ω/□)\nlabels = [\"Thin\", \"Medium\", \"Thick\"]\ncolors = [:green, :blue, :red]\np = plot(title=\"Costa Absorber\", xlim=(0,25),ylim=(-35,0),xtick=0:5:25,ytick=-35:5:0,\n         xlabel=\"Frequency (GHz)\", ylabel=\"Reflection Magnitude (dB)\", legend=:bottomleft)\nps = []\nfor (i,(ri, ro, label, color, R)) in enumerate(zip(r_inner, r_outer, labels, colors, Rs))\n    sheet = polyring(sides=4, s1=[D, 0], s2=[0, D], ntri=700, orient=45,\n                     a=[ri], b=[ro], Rsheet=R, units=mm)\n    push!(ps, plot(sheet, unitcell=true, title=label, lc=color))\n    strata = [Layer()\n              sheet\n              Layer(width=5mm)\n              pecsheet() # Perfectly conducting ground plane\n              Layer()]\n    results = analyze(strata, 1:0.2:25, (ϕ=0, θ=0), showprogress=false,\n                      resultfile=devnull, logfile=devnull)\n    data = extract_result(results, @outputs FGHz s11dB(h,h))\n    plot!(p, data[:,1], data[:,2], label=\"PSSFSS \"*label, lc=color)\n    dat = readdlm(\"../src/assets/costa_2014_\" * lowercase(label) * \"_reflection.csv\", ',')\n    plot!(p, dat[:,1], dat[:,2], label=\"Costa \"*label, ls=:dash, lc=color)\nend\nplot(ps..., layout=(1,3))\nsavefig(\"sqloop1.png\"); nothing  # hide","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/","page":"Examples","title":"Examples","text":"(Image: )","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/","page":"Examples","title":"Examples","text":"This run takes about 85 seconds on my machine.","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/","page":"Examples","title":"Examples","text":"p\nsavefig(p,\"sqloop2.png\"); nothing  # hide","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/","page":"Examples","title":"Examples","text":"(Image: )","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/","page":"Examples","title":"Examples","text":"It is useful to take a look at the log file created by PSSFSS for the last run above:","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/","page":"Examples","title":"Examples","text":"Starting PSSFSS analysis on 2021-05-05 at 15:22:09.955\n\n\nDielectric layer information...\n\nLayer  Width  units  epsr   tandel   mur  mtandel modes  beta1x  beta1y  beta2x  beta2y\n----- ------------- ------- ------ ------- ------ ----- ------- ------- ------- -------\n    1    0.0000  mm    1.00 0.0000    1.00 0.0000     2   571.2     0.0     0.0   571.2\n==================  Sheet   1  ========================   571.2     0.0     0.0   571.2\n    2    5.0000  mm    1.00 0.0000    1.00 0.0000    42   571.2     0.0     0.0   571.2\n==================  Sheet   2  ========================     0.0     0.0     0.0     0.0\n    3    0.0000  mm    1.00 0.0000    1.00 0.0000     2   571.2     0.0     0.0   571.2\n\n\n\nPSS/FSS sheet information...\n\nSheet  Loc         Style      Rot  J/M Faces Edges Nodes Unknowns  NUFP\n-----  ---  ---------------- ----- --- ----- ----- ----- -------- ------\n  1     1          polyring   0.0  J    753  1201   448    1058  567009\n  2     2              NULL   0.0  E      0     0     0       0       0\n\n...","category":"page"},{"location":"examples/","page":"Examples","title":"Examples","text":"Note from the dielectric layer report that there are 42 modes defined in the region between the ground plane and the FSS sheet.

In fact, if both sheets had been embedded in similar dielectric claddings (in the same order), then the GSM (generalized scattering matrix) computed for the sheet in its first location could be reused without additional computation for its second location.  In this case, though, only the spatial integrals are re-used.

The objective is defined as the largest value of RHCP reflected return loss, LHCP insertion loss, or reflected or transmitted axial ratio that occurs at any of the analysis frequencies (i.e. we are setting up for \"minimax\" optimization). Also, the let block allows the objective function to maintain persistent state in the variable bestf which is initialized to the largest 64-bit floating point value.

For convenience the following unit       suffixes are exported by this module: m, cm, mil, inch,       so one can specify, e.g., width=20mil.  Note that width can        be negative for the first and/or final layer of the composite structure,       which has the effect of shifting the phase reference plane towards       the interior of the composite structure.  This is sometimes needed        when interfacing with other programs, such as TEP file generation for       Ticra's GRASP program.\nϵᵣ or epsr: Relative permittivity of the dielectric.\ntanδ or tandel: Loss tangent (electrical) of the dielectric.\nμᵣ or mur: Relative permeability of the dielectric.\nmtanδ or mtandel: Loss tangent (magnetic) of the dielectric.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"reference/#PSSFSS.Elements.loadedcross","page":"Function Reference","title":"PSSFSS.Elements.loadedcross","text":"loadedcross(;s1::Vector{<:Real}, s2::Vector{<:Real}, L1::Real, L2::Real, w::Real, \n             ntri::Int, units::PSSFSSLength, kwargs...)\n!\n\nDescription:\n\nCreate a variable of type RWGSheet that contains the triangulation for a \"loaded cross\" type of geometry.
