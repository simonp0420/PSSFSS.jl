CITATION KEYS

A citation key is divided into two fields <authors>:<date> separated
by a colon.  The author field is constructed as follows.  If there is
only one author, the first four letters of his or her last name are
used to form the field (but only one letter each from prefixes; e.g.
van de Geign becomes vdge).  If there are two authors the first two
letters in their last names are used.  If there are three authors the
first two letters of the first are used with one letter from each of
the second and third.  If their are four or more, one letter from each
of the first four is used. In the case of more than one publication in
a single year by the same group of authors, an alphabetic digit (letter)
is appended to the year.

NAMES

Names appear in the order they appear in the reference, and entries
are alphabetized by the first name to appear.


Speaking of alphabetization, between some entries you will find
curious clusters of two letters--e.g.  -ac- -ad-.  They are used as
editor search string to aid in positioning the insertion point
within the reference base when inserting new items.

KEYWORDS

Each entry has a keyword field, labeled kwds.  The program
/usr/local/bin/bibsrch will search the file for matches in a user
specified combination of conjunctions, disjunctions, and negations.
The user can also specify the author.  The program /usr/local/bin/getkey
dumps the keywords on the standard output.  To get an alphabetized list
of all key words from the file antcad.bib try

          getkey ref | sort -uf > keywords

A number of abbreviations have been used to keep the kwds field to a
manageable size.  The program getkey prints out the definitions of these
abbreviations in the appropriate places.
(They are actually key words in the last article
of the base; take a look.)

       selective surfaces (FSS) with second-order bandpass responses
       is presented. The FSSs designed using this technique utilize
       non-resonant subwavelength constituting unit cells with unit
       cell dimensions and periodicities in the order of 0.15lambda0.
       It is demonstrated that using the proposed technique, second-
       order FSSs with an overall thickness of lambda0/30 can be
       designed. This is considerably smaller than the thickness of
       second-order FSSs designed using traditional techniques and
       could be particularly useful at lower frequencies with long
       wavelengths. To facilitate the design of this structure, an
       equivalent circuit based synthesis method is also presented in
       this paper. Two bandpass FSS prototypes operating at X-band are
       designed, fabricated, and tested. A free space measurement
       setup is used to thoroughly characterize the frequency
       responses of these prototypes for both the TE and TM
       polarizations and various angles of incidence. The frequency
       responses of these structures are shown to have a relatively
       low sensitivity to the angle of incidence. Principles of

       measurement results of two fabricated prototypes are presented

       alternate linear polarization that are shaped both in azimuth
       (sectored) and in elevation (squared cosecant). The design
       process is divided into several stages. First, the positions of
       the three feeds are established as well as the antenna geometry
       to produce the three beams in the required directions. Second,
       the phase distribution on the reflectarray surface, which
       produces the required beam shaping, is synthesized. Third, the
       sizes of the printed stacked patches are adjusted so that the
       phase-shift introduced by them matches the synthesized phase
       distribution. Finally, the radiation patterns are computed for
       the central and lateral beams, showing a shaping close to the
       requirements. A breadboard has been manufactured and measured
       in an anechoic chamber, showing a good behavior, which

       includes patch or ring elements of variable size. The aim is to
       have a smaller gradient (slower slope) of the reflected wave
       phase as a function of the elements' size to achieve a wider
       operational bandwidth and smaller susceptibility to
       manufacturing errors. The results obtained for single resonance
       elements demonstrate that a slower slope can be achieved using
       thicker substrates at the expense of an inadequate phase range
       of less than 300deg. This inadequate phase range leads to the
       reflectarray elements phase errors, which reduce its
       directivity. To overcome this problem the use of multiresonance
       multiring elements is postulated. It is shown that square and
       circular shaped multiple rings printed on a thick substrate can
       offer a slower phase slope and the phase range exceeding
       360deg. The achieved slopes and ranges of double rings are
       comparable with those of double stacked patches printed on the
       equivalent low permittivity dielectric substrate. Choosing
       suitable dimensions of double-ring elements, the phase
       characteristic can be made approximately a linear function of
       their size.},

This would have considerable impact on a proposed detailed study of the southern sky in the frequency range 1.27 to 1.47 GHz. With the present, single, prime-focus feed, this would take about 10 years to complete, but by using multiple beams, each with two orthogonal linear polarizations, the survey time would be reduced to a more manageable observing period. A combination of reflector scan-gain loss, as the feeds are displaced from the focus, and the limited number of available correlator units, restricts a practical array to about nine elements which, nevertheless, gives a substantial order of magnitude reduction in observing time. We describe here a preliminary study of the Parkes antenna performance with a cluster of nine feed horns, where each horn in the cluster is responsible for two orthogonal linear polarizations within a beam},

because  of  their  narrow  bandwidth.  Furthermore, the conventional array
antennas associated with the feeder network require a large size and suffer
from unwanted mutual coupling between the feeder network and the resonators

linear  and  2D  array  antennas  which  leads to a size reduction and high
performance.  A  description  of  the  analysis  method  is  exposed and an

employed  for  this  design  are well-adapted for the monolithic concept of
millimetre waves band active antennas.  They obtain a 12\% bandwidth

       improves the efficiency of the traditional AFS techniques and
       simplifies the AFS process. In order to enable the S-B
       algorithm to be used in the proposed S-B AFS approach, three
       legitimate grid paths for constructing two pairs of
       complementary rational models are being proposed in this paper
       for modeling a general microwave circuit. Four practical broad-
       band examples are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
       S-B AFS, including waveguide harmonic filters, a waveguide
       diplexer, and a broad-band microstrip diplexer.},

antenna  is  a  logical  choice for this application because in addition to
meeting  the  electrical specifications, the antenna is flat in appearance,
and  is  capable of dual polarisation operation. The patch antenna can also
be  built  with  relatively  low  weight and cost. A 20 dB aperture coupled
patch antenna has been demonstrated.  The wide bandwidth is accomplished by using
a thick, foam substrate, with aperture-coupled excitation. Better than 8\% bandwidth is
achieved for VSWR = 2."

We describe an efficient EM-field/circuit co-optimization technique, which uses the advantages of both, EM-field solvers and circuit simulators. With this approach a fast and accurate design of complex feed chain systems, comprised of a high number of different and interacting waveguide components, as part of a multi-beam satellite antenna is possible. The feed chain was manufactured using conventional techniques. The measurement results are in a very good agreement with the simulation results.},

  abstract = {Probe-corrected spherical near-field antenna measurements with an
       arbitrary probe set certain requirements on an applicable
       scanning technique. The computational complexity of the general
       high-order probe correction technique for an arbitrary probe,
       that is based on the Phi scanning, is O(N4), where N is
       proportional to the radius of the antenna under test (AUT)
       minimum sphere in wavelengths. With the present knowledge, the
       computational complexity of the probe correction for arbitrary
       probes in the case of the thetas scanning is O(N-6), which is
       typically not acceptable. This paper documents a specific
       double Phi-step thetas scanning technique for spherical near-
       field antenna measurements. This technique not only constitutes
       an alternative spherical scanning technique, but it also
       enables formulating an associated probe correction technique
       for arbitrary probes with the computational complexity of 0(N4)
       while the possibility for the exploitation of the advantages of
       the thetas scanning are maintained.},

  abstract = {A highly flexible synthesis method for an arbitrary array is proposed
       to best approximate a desired array pattern in a minimum-mean-
       square-error sense. The basic idea of the technique is to form
       a quadratic program with its cost function given by the mean-
       square error between the array response and a properly selected
       pattern described by a known mathematical function. This
       quadratic program can be a constrained or unconstrained
       optimization problem depending on the requirements of the
       desired array pattern. In formulating the quadratic program, no
       assumption has been made on the gain/phase response or
       characteristics of the individual array elements. Therefore,
       one can synthesize an array of arbitrary shape to any
       appropriate pattern with the characteristic of the array
       elements taken into consideration as long as one is able to
       model the array accurately. The proposed method is used to
       synthesize arrays of different shapes, linear as well as planar
       arrays (including rectangular and circular planar arrays),
       using a Chebyshev polynomial or zero function as a design
       template, to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed method},

             The integral transform method with the asymptotic extraction technique is
             formulated for calculating a Sommerfeld-type integral problem.
             This formulation allows the infinite double integral of the asymptotic

abstract={Lambda functions, a class of functions resembling the Bessel functions,
have many applications in antenna theory. This paper shows their application to describe
some of the properties of dipoles. The field components of an electrically short dipole are
usually expressed in terms of the inverse distance $1/r$ and its powers $1/r^{2}$ and $1/r^{3}$.
It is shown that the functions containing $r$ are Lambda functions. The field components can then
be concisely expressed in Lambda notation and the range dependence is easily determined from standard
tables and graphs of the Lambda functions. The Lambda characterization of the field arises from the
vector potential being itself a simple Lambda function. Lambda functions then enter into
applications of short dipoles and simplify the descriptions. Examples are given in
respect of mutual coupling, gain formulas, and lines of force. The paper contains a
short account of the definitions and properties of the Lambda
functions required for the dipole applications.},

integral equations is avoided by implementing instead the simplified
expressions of the Green's function. By avoiding the calculation of
Sommerfeld integrals, the numerical procedure becomes very efficient.
However, this may compromise the accuracy of the method. The final solution
for the integral equation is acquired numerically by implementing the
Method of Moments. Surface current can be extracted from the solution and
will provide a starting point for analysis of microstrip structures. The
reliability and efficiency of this approach is thoroughly examined and
verified by comparing the solution with results obtained from an
established microstrip CAD tool.
The ``simplified'' expressions used
for the Green's functions are the exact formulas for the quasi-static
portion as presented by Mosig and Gardiol.  Although the authors
obtain good results for their test case, their dielectric thickness is
quite small, $h/\lambda \approx 0.015$, so that surface wave
excitation is negligible.  For thicker substrates this approximate
method is expected to produce much poorer results."

       beam antenna testing, a broad beam antenna such as a standard
       gain horn, which is needed for a gain level reference, must
       often be measured in a planar near-field range. Typically, the
       accuracy of a broad beam antenna measurement is limited by the
       truncation error caused by the finite size of the scan plane
       and relatively large field levels at the edge resulting in an

       The truncation error can be minimized by applying a window

       proper window function is not straightforward. In this paper,
       an insightful formulation of a near-field scan data window is

   abstract = {The paper provides a tutorial review of a number of offset parabolic reflector configurations including both
               single and double-reflector geometries. The author commences by describing some basic techniques which can be
               applied to predict the vector radiation fields and provides some indication of the validity of these methods.
               The formulation of a relatively simple analytical model for the offset reflector antenna is described based upon
               the physical-optics approximation. The electrical performance of the single-offset reflector is examined by comparison
               of predicted and measured data. The particular problems arising from the choice of polarisation and reflector dimensions
               are highlighted, and some practical applications involving multiple beams, shaped and contoured beams, monopulse
               tracking and low sidelobes are briefly reviewed. Practical primary-feeds for offset-reflector antennas are
               discussed and the matched-feed concept is outlined, the matching of the electric fields in the primary-feed aperture
               to the reflector focal fields being illustrated. The advantages and disadvantages of dual-reflector antennas are then
               examined, with particular emphasis upon the open Cassegrainian configuration and the optimised double offset
               configuration which offers, in principle, both freedom from blockage and low levels of cross-polarised radiation.}

operate at two frequencies corresponding to two various resonant modes. The
separation  between  the  two  frequency  bands could be altered by placing
shorting  pins  at the proper locations on the nodal lines of the fields of
one  of  the modes. If both frequency bands are required to be too close to
each  other,  at least, two patches have to be used simply by stacking them
together.  Using any of the above techniques, two separate narrow frequency
bands  may  be obtained. However, in some antenna applications, the antenna
is  required  to  operate  at  two  separate  frequency  broadbands. A very
important  example  of  such  applications  is the antenna used in cellular
phones.  Using  a  dual-band  antenna  having  two separate bands, helps in
eliminating  the lossy expensive duplexer or at least making it cheaper and
easier  to design especially if two separate feeds could be used. A compact
microstrip  antenna has been developed for such an application. It consists
of  a  driven  element  and five small parasitic patches distributed in two
stacked layers. The two layers have similar geometries and their dimensions
are almost equal. The author achieves about 3\% bandwidth."

  number={10},
  pages={2406 -2415},
  abstract={The cutoff wavelengths $\lambda_{cmn}$ of elliptical metallic waveguides with
           perfectly conducting walls are determined analytically. Two different methods
           are used for the evaluation. In the first, the electromagnetic field is expressed
           in terms of elliptical-cylindrical wave functions. In the second, a shape
           perturbation method, the field is expressed in terms of circular-cylindrical
           wave functions only, while the equation of the elliptical boundary is given in
           polar coordinates. Analytical expressions are obtained for the cutoff wavelengths,
           when the solution is specialized
           to small values of the eccentricity $h=c/2a, (h\llt 1)$, with $c$ the interfocal
           distance of the elliptical waveguide and $2a$ the length of its major axis. In this case,
           exact closed-form algebraic expressions, free of Mathieu as well as of Bessel functions,
           are obtained for the expansion coefficients $g_{mn}^{(2)}$ and $g_{mn}^{(4)}$
           in the resulting relation
           $\lambda_{cmn}(h)=\lambda_{cmn}^{(0)} [1 + g_{mn}^{(2)}h^2 + g_{mn}^{(4)}h^4 + O(h^6)]$
           for the cutoff wavelengths. These expressions are valid for each $m$ and $n$, namely,

  abstract = {Satellite broadcasting services operated in the 12 GHz-band are
       currently provided in Japan. Furthermore, the technical
       development of areas such as future 21 GHz-band satellite
       broadcasting systems is also in progress. One of the major
       technical difficulties with the satellite broadcasting systems
       using such frequency bands is the large rain attenuation caused
       by heavy rainfall. A method for compensating for rain
       attenuation is necessary to avoid the interruption of
       broadcasting reception. We have been studying an advanced
       broadcasting satellite system having an on-board large-scale
       phased array antenna. This system can compensate for rain
       attenuation by increasing the radiation power over areas of
       heavy rainfall. The adaptive pattern synthesis technique of the
       phased array antenna makes it possible to reconfigure the
       radiation pattern (equivalent isotropically radiated power:
       EIRP) according to the distribution of rainfall on the service
       area. We describe the results of a basic study focused on (1)
       the radiation pattern requirements that systems such as
       broadcasting satellite systems with variable EIRIP will have to
       satisfy and, (2) pattern synthesis methods for an array-fed
       reflector antenna based on singular value decomposition (SVD)},

  abstract = {A parallel genetic algorithm (GA) optimization tool has been developed
       for the synthesis of arbitrarily shaped beam coverage using
       planar 2-D phased-array antennas. Typically, the synthesis of a
       contoured beam footprint using a planar 2-D array is difficult
       because of the inherently large number of degrees of freedom
       involved (in general, the amplitude and phase of each element
       must be determined). We make use of a parallel GA tool in this
       study to compensate for this aspect of the design problem. The
       algorithm essentially compares a desired pattern envelope with
       that of trial arrays, and quantifies the effectiveness or
       desirability of each test case via a fitness function. The GA
       uses this information to rank and select subsequent arrays over
       a given number of generations via the conventional stochastic
       operators, i.e., selection, crossover, and mutation. Each
       fitness evaluation of a trial pattern is done on a node of the
       Aerospace Fellowship cluster supercomputer, which increases the
       speed of the algorithm linearly with the number of nodes.
       Because of the continuous nature of the parameters for this
       optimization problem, a real parameter encoding scheme is
       employed for the GA chromosome in order to avoid the
       quantization errors associated with a binary representation. A
       benchmark 10 $,times,$10 (100) element array is employed, and
       various results of optimized coverage patterns are shown herein
       to illustrate the effectiveness and validity of the technique.},

       communication systems, i.e. antennas having the main beam
       shaped so that its footprint on ground closely follows the
       contour of specific geographical regions (e.g. Europe or the
       U.S.), with the objective of maximizing the radiation
       efficiency and reducing interferences with neighbouring
       regional systems. The reference solution for this work are "
       array-fed" reflectors, i.e. antennas fed by an array of horns
       or equivalent radiating elements, each producing a "component"
       beam toward a different direction upon reflection on the
       reflection dish. The idea behind this work is to find an
       efficient representation of the desired radiation pattern that
       concentrates the field information relevant to the design task
       in few, suitably constructed functions; if properly coded, this
       enables synthesis algorithms to converge faster. The proposed
       approach exploits the properties of the multi-resolution (MR)
       representation. We have generated a wavelet system suitable to
       the coverage problem of present interest. In this paper we
       consider array-fed offset reflector antennas. Two very
       different synthesis techniques are considered as application
       examples of the devised pattern representation: 1) a simple
       (and fast) field synthesis projection method; and 2) a power
       synthesis via an optimization based on a genetic algorithm

In this paper, various approaches are discussed for maximizing the utility

In summary, through careful implementation, the complex image method has been
applied in this work in the development of an efficient, practical analysis program.
This has been made possible by maximizing the robustness of the method, through the
introduction of an automatic contour selection scheme, in conjunction with Aksun's

  abstract = {A method to analyze a one-dimensional array comprising tilted edge
       slots cut in the narrow wall of a rectangular waveguide is
       presented. The fields in the slots are calculated from a hybrid
       finite element-boundary integral (FE-BI) equation method. The
       boundary surface integrals on both the interior and exterior
       surface of the slots are computed from a spectrum of two-
       dimensional solutions (S2DS), which allows the influence of
       both the interior and exterior structure of the waveguide to be
       included rigorously. For initial array design, the mutual
       coupling between slots in the exterior region is treated
       approximately with an infinite array assumption modeled by two
       slots surrounded by periodic boundary walls with an imposed
       linear phase progression. A short, finite slot array is
       designed based on the infinite array assumption and fabricated.
       Results from full-wave analysis of the array and measurements
       are presented},

       moments, the modal Green's function is used, which is defined
       as the radiation field of a circular loop antenna with
       sinusoidal current distribution. It is a group of oscillating
       integrals that forms the bottleneck for further accelerating
       the computation of BoR problems. In this paper, we propose
       closed-form expressions for near-axis far-distance modal
       Green's functions, which can be used to accelerate the
       computation of BoR problems especially when the object is slim.
       A criterion is presented based on a rigorous error analysis to
       guarantee its range of applications. Both the scattering and
       radiation examples are presented to demonstrate the validity
       and efficiency of the proposed expressions.},

             thick are studied using the mixed potential integral equation approach.  Vector basis functions
             defined over triangular elements are used to approximate the current distribution on the conducting
             patch.  Rigorous and simplified models of the probe-to-patch junction, compatible with the triangular
             element model of the microstrip patch, are implemented and their ranges of validity are examined.
             Input impedance data for several microstrip patch antennas of different shapes, computed using
             different coaxial feed models, are presented and compared with measured results.  Two distinct issues
             associated with modeling a coaxial feed are examined in this paper.  The first is the question of
             whether the currents on the feed center conductor need to be solved for as part of the solution
             process.  From the results presented in the paper, it appears that the answer is in the affirmative
             when the substrate thickness exceeds approximately 0.03 wavelengths (in the dielectric).  Secondly,
             two different choices for an attachment mode are examined. The first, more rigorous definition
             incorporates the expected radial divergence of the current emanating from the feed point.  The
             second, simpler formulation employs linear combinations of the already existing basis functions
             on triangle faces adjacent to the feed node.  The simpler attachment mode appears to generate
             results of very nearly equal accuracy to the more rigourous mode, even in the case of thick
             substrates.  There is also the advantage for this mode of a
             of a much more natural integration into the computational framework  used with the triangle
             subdomain basis functions."
